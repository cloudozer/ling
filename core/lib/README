Dependencies on the external libraries
======================================

Ling requires the following libraries:

1. lwIP (TCP/IP networking)
2. Nettle (Low-level crypto)
3. PCRE (Regular expressions)
4. uClibc (General low-level functions)

The dependency on the external libraries is minimized. Only the portion of the
Nettle library that does not use bignums is imported. Just a handful of
functions are imported from uClibc and the dependency on uClibc can be avoided
with a little effort. lwIP and PCRE are imported almost fully.

How to obtain and build the libraries
=====================================

1. lwIP
-------

Ling is using the current development branch of lwIP. The source code was
obtained from a Git repo at git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/lwip.git and
incorporated into Ling sources. There are multiple changes to lwIP sources
almost exclusively related to debug/error messages. A few files were added under
lib/lwip/ling directory.

Use 'make' or 'make -C lib/lwip' to build the library.

2. Nettle
---------

Nettle should be obtained from a Git repo:

git clone git://git.lysator.liu.se/nettle/nettle.git

To configure the library use the following command:

./configure --disable-public-key --disable-shared --disable-pic --disable-openssl

Use 'make' to build libnettle.a.
Use 'sudo make install' to install the library.

3. PCRE
-------

Ling uses a particular version of PCRE - 7.6. Obtain the library from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/pcre/7.6/pcre-7.6.tar.gz/download.

ATTENTION. Copy pcre_assert.h file to pcre directory as assert.h.
	Copy pcre_globals.c file to pcre directory.

Now build it using the following commands:

./configure --disable-shared --disable-cpp --disable-stack-for-recursion --enable-utf8
				--enable-unicode-properties CFLAGS=-O2 --no-recursion

Then 'make' the library.
4. uClibc

Obtain uClibc source from http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.33.2.tar.bz2.
Copy openling/deps/uClibc_config file to uClibc directory as .config. Use 'make'
to build the library. You may need to run 'make menuconfig' to adjust the
target architecture: x86_32 or x86_64.

Use 'sudo make install' to install the library.

Prerequisites
-------------

To build LING from sources, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. Erlang/OTP

The installed version of Erlang/OTP must be R16B01. It means that it must be
build from sources available at http://erlang.org.

2. uClibc

The version known to work is 0.9.33.2. Other versions must work too.  LING
requires a static version of the library. Ubuntu and, possibly, other
distributions do not include the static version.

When building uClibc from source, you can use lib/uClibc_config as the
configuration file.

3. Nettle

LING uses the Nettle library for cryptographic primitives. The version known to
work is 2.7.1. The static version of the library is required. It may or may not
be available as a binary package. To build from sources is always an option.
